[Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) has published a case study on how CMSO is using and adapting its specifications and tools for cell migration standards.

You can read the case study [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/case-studies/cmso/).

The article presents the three main standards blocks of CMSO, as shown in the Figure below.

In particular, the [biotracks](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/biotracks) format/library is introduced, as it is based on the [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification developed by the Frictionless Data team.
