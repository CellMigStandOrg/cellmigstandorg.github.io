CMSO has been working on a set of standards to build Findable, Acessible, Interoperable and Reusable (or by its acronym, [FAIR](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) data. [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org)
is a curated, informative and educational portal providing information about data and metadata standards. CMSO and FAIRsharing have been working together on registering the standards produced in CMSO as well as related standards that
are relevant to CMSO. FAIRsharing also links the standards with relevant databases and data policies.

FAIRsharing allows users to create collections. Collections group together one or more types of resource (standard, database or policy) by different criteria, such as domain, project or organisation.

CMSO created a collection in FAIRsharing including reporting guidelines, terminologies, and models or formats that are relevant to the cell migration community. The collection can be seen following [this link](https://fairsharing.org/collection/CellMigrationStandardisationOrganisation).

Recently, the [FAIRsharing team](https://fairsharing.org) has also produced a widget that allows to embed FAIRsharing collections in other web pages. The widget allows to visualize the different resources in the collection as a table or as a graph. The
graph view shows the network of relationships among the resources in the collection. You can move the graph around, see summary information for each node and click on each node to see its whole record in FAIRsharing. It is also possible to visualise other related resources
that are currently not in the collection. This may allow organisations to consider resources of which they may not have been aware.

We are now using the FAIRsharing widget for the CMSO collection in our page, and you can visit it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/fairsharing-widget/).
