“Towards a standardized cell migration data ecosystem ”

The second workshop of the
[Cell Migration Standardization Organization]({{ site.baseurl }}) will be
held in Galveston, Texas on the 27 th and 28 th of January 2017. Recent
technological advances have transformed cell migration into a data-intensive
field lacking intra- and inter-lab data management solutions, standardization
and dissemination infrastructure. CMSO defines and implements community
standards as a cornerstone infrastructure for the creation of a comprehensive,
open and free data exchange ecosystem for cell migration.

The CMSO works on community standards for the field of cell migration in three
working groups: Minimal Reporting Requirements, Controlled Vocabularies, and
Standard Formats and Software APIs.

More detailed information can be found on this website (see links in header
above).

Participation in the workshop is free for all attendees, but do note that
participants will have to pay for their own transport and accommodation.
