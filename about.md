The CMSO is a young organization that has a specific goal: to facilitate the development of community standards for the field of cell migration.

As such, the CMSO is based on voluntary efforts from the community, and is 
open for anyone interested to contribute towards the creation and maintenance 
of the standards.

If you are interested in the people behind the CMSO, you can find these

If you are interested in the work performed by the CMSO, have a look at the 
working groups that are listed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/groups).

The CMSO is supported by the [MULTIMOT](http://multimot.org/) project of the
[European Commissionâ€™s H2020 programme](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/193270_en.html).
