Controlled vocabularies are a key element to ensure unambiguous annotation of
data and results. Controlled vocabularies are moreover designed to be both
human as well as machine readable.

The goal of this working group is to examine existing controlled vocabularies
(CVs) for re-use where possible, to propose the addition of terms to an
existing CV where appropriate, and to create a novel CV where necessary.
