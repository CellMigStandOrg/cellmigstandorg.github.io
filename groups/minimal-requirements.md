Minimal reporting requirements are crucial in order to ensure that sufficient
information is reported on a study to allow correct interpretation of the
results, but also to allow reproduction of the study itself, if desired.

Minimal reporting requirements typically take the form of a document with
guidelines or rules that state which information is considered essential when
reporting on a given procedure, technique or analysis.

The goal of this group is to create this document.
