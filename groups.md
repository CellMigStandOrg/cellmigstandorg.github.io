The CMSO consists of three working groups, each covering a specific topic of
interest in the standardization of the field of cell migration.

These three working groups are:

- Minimal reporting requirements working group
- Controlled vocabularies working group
- Data formats and API standards working group

Of course, there needs to be considerable interaction between the different
working groups, but this split along topical lines allows the working groups
to focus on a specific standardization aspect internally.


## Minimal reporting requirements

Minimal reporting requirements are crucial in order to ensure that sufficient
information is reported on a study to allow correct interpretation of the
results, but also to allow reproduction of the study itself, if desired.

Minimal reporting requirements typically take the form of a document with
guidelines or rules that state which information is considered essential when
reporting on a given procedure, technique or analysis.

The goal of this group is to create this document.

### MIACME v0.1 release

The Minimal Information About a Cell Migration Experiment (MIACME) 
specification have been released in version 0.1, and are now open for comments!

Please find the main page with the documentation of this specification on the 
CMSO GitHub:

https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/MIACME

The direct link to the Google spreadsheet, that is currently open for 
comments, can be found below:

### Survey

A community driven survey has been created with the latest draft of minimal 
reporting guidelines. The purpose is to gain input on the quality and the
necessity of the proposed requirements to take into account during further
discussion.

The survey can be found [here](https://goo.gl/3YlAu1).

## Controlled vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are a key element to ensure unambiguous annotation of
data and results. Controlled vocabularies are moreover designed to be both
human as well as machine readable.

The goal of this working group is to examine existing controlled vocabularies
(CVs) for re-use where possible, to propose the addition of terms to an
existing CV where appropriate, and to create a novel CV where necessary.


## Data formats and API standards 

Standards formats and standard software APIs are instrumental tools to ensure
that all data, results and associated metadata in a field can be readily read
and correctly interpreted by any relevant software package.

This working group will therefore focus on creating standard formats and
software libraries for the field of cell migration.
