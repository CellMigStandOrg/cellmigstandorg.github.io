The CMSO consists of three working groups, each covering a specific topic of
interest in the standardization of the field of cell migration.

These three working groups are:

- Minimal reporting requirements working group
- Controlled vocabularies working group
- Data formats and API standards working group

Of course, there needs to be considerable interaction between the different
working groups, but this split along topical lines allows the working groups
to focus on a specific standardization aspect internally.


## Minimal reporting requirements

Minimal reporting requirements are crucial in order to ensure that sufficient
information is reported on a study to allow correct interpretation of the
results, but also to allow reproduction of the study itself, if desired.

Minimal reporting requirements typically take the form of a document with
guidelines or rules that state which information is considered essential when
reporting on a given procedure, technique or analysis. 

This working group has delivered increasingly refined and tested versions of 
the Minimal Information About a Cell Migration Experiment (MIACME).

The outcomes of this working group are:
- [the MIACME specifications](MIACME) that describe what is required for the reporting 
of cell migration experiments both in a narrative document as well as in machine-readable and
actionable schemas; the specifications also describe the process followed to define the 
guidelines in an incremental way and by engaging the cell migration community
- [a set of datasets](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/CMSO-datasets) that demonstrate the use
of the MIACME guidelines and their relation to the other CMSO outcomes  

### Process

The process to derive the MIACME guidelines is described in the specifications. 

One of the elements of this process was to design a community driven survey with a draft 
draft of minimal reporting guidelines. The purpose was to gain input on the quality and the
necessity of the proposed requirements to take into account during further
discussion.

## Controlled vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are a key element to ensure unambiguous annotation of
data and results. Controlled vocabularies are moreover designed to be both
human as well as machine readable.

The goal of this working group was to examine existing controlled vocabularies
(CVs) for re-use where possible, to propose the addition of terms to an
existing CV where appropriate, and to create a novel CV where necessary.


## Data formats and API standards 

Standards formats and standard software APIs are instrumental tools to ensure
that all data, results and associated metadata in a field can be readily read
and correctly interpreted by any relevant software package.

This working group will therefore focus on creating standard formats and
software libraries for the field of cell migration.
