The CMSO consists of three working groups, that each cover a specific topic of
interest in the standardization of the field of cell migration.

These three working groups are:

- [Minimal reporting requirements working group](/groups/minimal-requirements)
- [Controlled vocabularies working group](/groups/controlled-vocabularies)
- [Data formats and API standards working group](/groups/formats-api)

Of course, there needs to be considerable interaction between the different
working groups, but this split along topical lines allows the working groups
to focus on a specific standardization aspect internally.
